# Mobile Price Prediction
Mobile price prediction project which aims to examine various feature selection methods and train model to observe accuracy improvement.

# Introduction
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.

Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.

In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

# Objective
To examine different feature selection techniques and observe how they will improve classification accuracy. 

In feature selection, the main aim is to select the features which are highly dependent on the response.

Model used throughout the project will be RandomForestClassier with default hyperparameters only.

# Variance Threshold
All features are non-unary

# Correlation Coefficient

If two variables are correlated, we can predict one from the other. Therefore, if two features are correlated, the model only really needs one of them, as the second one does not add additional information

Per Pearson Correlation check, there's no correlation above 0.85.
